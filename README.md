# THIS IS REALLY BAD ATM PLEASE FORGIVE ME
### Possibly an implementation of Minimax for tictactoe
To play with the "AI", pull the _wtfidk_ branch then from _lib_ run:
`ruby spike.rb`

The minimax "logic" is contained in mm.rb - which is _quite_ a mess...
# ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

I will try and make it nicer eventually.
